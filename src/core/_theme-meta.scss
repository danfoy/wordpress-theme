/*
This is the theme header. WordPress requires a file named `style.css` exist in
the root template directory with the following header in order for it to
recognise the generated folder as a template.

Block comments starting slash-star-bang are preserved in the output after
minification. Since Sass' transition to the new module format, this header
must itself be provided as a module in order for it to appear at the top of
the output file - it will be stripped if moved directly to `main.scss`.
